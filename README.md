# Visualizing-the-Qualitative-Results-of-Segmentation

This repository contains python codes done for segmentation visualization as part of my research article published in Neurocomputing.
The python visualizes the qualitative results for the ground-truth, 3D U-Net, and JDHCL framework proposed in this research article.
